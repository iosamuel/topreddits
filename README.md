## Step by step on decisions made for this test
Since this is a really simple single-page, I decided to use a simplified version of vue, vuetify (for material design layout) and jquery (mostly for the ajax request)

Since the commit `8666e5c` I used lodash, because I think its a must in every javascript project, because all of this really useful utilities. Here I use it to unescape the posts html from reddit. In this commit I will take a break and continue after my other responsibilites are done.
